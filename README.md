# StarterHacks
Code for an automatic medication dispenser, created at StarterHacks 2019.

The dispenser automatically releases pills at specified times. 
When one type of pill runs low, a Facebook message is sent to the patient's doctor, and an LED light changes from green to yellow.
When one type of pill runs out, another Facebook message is sent to the doctor, and the light changes from yellow to red.
