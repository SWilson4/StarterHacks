# StarterHacks
Code for an automatic medication dispenser, created at StarterHacks 2019.

The dispenser automatically releases pills at specified times. Counters keep track of the number of pills of each type.
When one runs low, a Facebook message is sent to the patient's doctor, and an LED light changes from green to yellow.
When one runs out, another Facebook message is sent to the doctor, and the light changes from yellow to red.
